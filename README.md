Elegant Code Maker
==================
Engine able to make any code really stay elegant. View online demo here: http://elegantcodemaker.apphb.com

Yes, this is a joke!
--------------------
Really, this is a fake engine that not analyzes and applies properly techniques to make code more elegant. 

In my arrogant opinion, generally, there is some consensus about what an elegant code, in fact. However, I have seen some elegant code samples that add complexity, verbosity and other uncomfortable issues. Of course, there are some things in any development language that push code from “acceptable” to “impressive” level. 

Truthfully, every developer has a different definition of elegance and all may be correct under a proper perspective - or not :). So, the development of a *perfect* elegant code maker is an intangible task.
